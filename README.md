#   GBR_TBG
*   **Predictive Machine Learning Model to Estimate Conductance in Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG)**

##   ðŸ“Œ Overview
*   This script provides a predictive Machine Learning Model to Estimate Conductance of Twisted Bilayer Graphene devices presented in the article: Layer-Resolved Quantum Transport in Twisted Bilayer Graphene: Counterflow and Machine Learning Predictions. The process integrates data normalization, clustering with a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), and regression with Gradient Boosting Regressors (GBR).

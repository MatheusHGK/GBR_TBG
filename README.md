#   GBR_TBG
*   **Predictive Machine Learning Model to Estimate Conductance in Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG)**

##   ðŸ“Œ Overview
*   This repository provides a machine learning-based framework for predicting conductance in **Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG)** using **Gradient Boosting Regressors (GBR)** and **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**. The approach significantly reduces computational costs compared to traditional simulations while maintaining high accuracy.
